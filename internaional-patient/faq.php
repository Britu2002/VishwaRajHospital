 <span class="font-bold ">What are the common causes of kidney stones?</span> 

Kidney stones can be caused by various factors including recurrent infections like urinary tract infections (UTIs), hot climate leading to increased concentration of solutes in urine, dehydration due to inadequate water intake, metabolic causes such as hyperparathyroidism and gout, immobility or sedentary lifestyle, presence of Randall’s plaques, renal anomalies like PUJ obstruction, family history of stone formation, and certain drugs.

<p class="mb-4 text-justify">
  <span class="font-bold">Does diet affect the formation of kidney stones?   </span>
  Yes, diet can affect the formation of kidney stones. Not drinking enough water, having a diet rich in red meat, dry fruits, calcium, and oxalates can increase the risk of kidney stone formation.

  <span class="font-bold">What are some risk factors for heart disease in women?  </span>
Women can make several lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of heart disease, including quitting or not starting smoking, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a heart-healthy diet that includes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and lean meats. Women should also take prescribed medications appropriately and manage other conditions that are risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.

 <span class="font-bold">A heart attack usually occurs when the blood cannot flow to the heart smoothly. Also known as myocardial infarction, a heart attack can become lethal quickly. However, due to advanced medical treatments, it is now possible to save people’s life more than before.</span> 
Now you might be wondering – does your body give you any warning signs before a heart attack? For this, you need to know that not all attacks are the same. Some come with a wide range of symptoms, while others offer very few. But, there are also some cardiovascular attacks that emerge all of a sudden.

However, in the majority of the cases, the body gives off plenty of warning signs. Generally, these symptoms occur months before the actual attack. You just need to be able to decipher them properly to take preventive steps.

Drooling is the flowing of saliva from the mouth. It is a common symptom for numerous medical disorders of nose, ears, throat, and even neurological problems. If drooling occurs in toddlers or new-born babies, then that is perfectly normal. It is usually a sign that the baby is going to start teething. Moreover, there is no need for concern. But, when it occurs in adults or the cause is not clear, then that is cause for alarm.
